# SMP Demo (Shadow Memory Protocol)

This is a **toy simulation** that shows how SMP reconstructs a user profile
from **anchors, entities, and events** via short, disciplined loops.

> No external APIs, no storage. Itâ€™s just a local reconstruction ritual.

## Quick Start
```bash
python simulation.py
